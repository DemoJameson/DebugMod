Original mod by KeinZantezuken. Remaking using canvas instead of imgui and the modding framework created by myself and MyEyes/Firzen.

# How to build:
Make a folder `Source/References/`, and add `Assembly-CSharp.dll` (with modding-api), `PlayMaker.dll`, `UnityEngine.dll`, and `UnityEngine.UI.dll` from your `Hollow Knight/hollow_knight_Data/Managed/`-folder
